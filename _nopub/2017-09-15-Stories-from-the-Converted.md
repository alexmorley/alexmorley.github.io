title: Stories from the Converted: How I moved on from Matlab
---

I'm not going to go off on one today about why I feel scientific software needs to be open, or rant about all of things I hate about matlab. I never really gave it a chance tbqh so I'm far from impartial when discussing its relative merits or pitfalls. If you wanted to read why maybe it's not a great thing to teach students then I recommend [this post](o g) from Olivia Guest\*.

\* who also came up with the idea to share these stories

Instead, I'm just going to share stories/tweets/quotes from people who used to use Matlab, but have now moved on, or are in the process of it. Maybe at some point "for balance" (as if I'm writing for the BBC) I'll include some stories from people who never switched (or if I can find them people who went the other way). But maybe not. Got a better/different reason. @ me on twitter or comment below and I'll add it to this post.

First a convert of Open Science. A good reason me thinks.

Speed, speed, speed.

Thanks to the work of all the great people trying to create Open and (way better) neuro-imaging specific packages. [@ChrisFiloG](https://twitter.com/ChrisFiloG) comes to mind.
