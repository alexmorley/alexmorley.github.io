# SSI Fellowship
## What are?
Hey! I'm a [Software Sustainability Fellow](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme). This is the repo I use for planning all the little things that don't get their own dedicated space.

## Why Github for something like this?
- Some of my presentations are written as website and benefit from version control.
- I can write notes and edit posts from anywhere with a browser.
- In the spirit of the fellowship I'd like everything (for which it is appropriate) to be open (I know github itself isn't open source but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )
