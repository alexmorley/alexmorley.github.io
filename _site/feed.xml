        <title>What can Research Software Learn from Human-Centered Design?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/underexposed.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 60%&quot; alt=&quot;underexposed logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A couple weeks ago I went on a week long residency learning about human- or user- centered design. I learnt a lot, but am obviously not an expert. Thus the aim of this post is to share what I learned and my opinion about why a wider consideration of these techniques could be a good thing, rather than tell you how to run your project…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note2: I drafted this post with research software in mind -as that’s where my background is- but I don’t think anything here is specific to this domain, and so the title may be changed to reflect that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organic-oss-development&quot;&gt;“Organic OSS” Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into what human-centered design is I first want to outline a common pattern that we see in Open Source software development. The pattern in the comic below is not a bad one, indeed it has served many communities extremely well. But it is important to consider the limitations of such a pattern, as well as its strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/draft-comic.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Comic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros---theres-a-lot-of-cool-stuff-going-on-here&quot;&gt;Pros - there’s a lot of cool stuff going on here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Organic”&lt;/strong&gt; - requires little extra energy or time at the start of a project beyond what would have been required anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-use&lt;/strong&gt; - lot’s of people don’t have to implement the same piece of software because it’s already been done for them and shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Building&lt;/strong&gt; - allowing people to develop the features that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want, and submit them back to the project is a great way to build community and can be a formative experience for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons---but-also-some-inherent-limitations&quot;&gt;Cons - but also some inherent limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Choice&lt;/strong&gt; - the features that get implemented are often the ones that &lt;em&gt;developers&lt;/em&gt; want which may or may not overlap with the rest of the user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback Bias&lt;/strong&gt; - in a similar vein, the feedback that a project will get can be biased towards developers, or those who are more tech-savvy. Furthermore, the &lt;em&gt;absolute limit&lt;/em&gt; of the possible feedback you can get is from your user base, there is little scope for addressing a &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience&lt;/strong&gt; - as a result of this, and the rest of the process lack of consideration for users outside of the developer-base can result in a worse experience for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-centered-design&quot;&gt;Human-Centered Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is human-centered design and how can it help us reduce some of the cons while keeping the pros of open software development. As the name suggests the aim is to put humans, or users, at the center of the design process. In this context, the key is that users are involved from the very beginning of the process, even in the ideas stage. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of what people need from a piece of software before you commit to building it a certain way. Then as the project evolves, we keep &lt;em&gt;seeking detailed feedback that guides our decision-making&lt;/em&gt;. This is critically different from user research that seeks to validate decisions that have already been made (an almost useless endevour) and not limited to research that just seeks to test which of two or three choices is best (like an A/B test, although these have their place too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-research&quot;&gt;User Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As user research is critical to this design process you might be thinking, great we’ve already lost the first “Pro” of OSS development “requires little extra energy at the start”. And to some extent this is true, there is an upfront cost but first I would like to show you that there are ways to do this with a small inital time/resource investment and secondly how the value that you can extract later on will more than offset this investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chart of 20 user research methods, classified along 3 dimensions&quot; src=&quot;//s3.amazonaws.com/media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2014/10/10/user-research-methods.png&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph above is quite a complete overview of what different methods of user-research are possible (click on the image for a description of each of them). Which are available to you will depend on your project. An early-stage project is more likely to benefit from mostly qualitative research such as interviews or ethnographic studies. These sound time-intensive but you can cheat a bit. Instead of recruiting participants and setting up interviews you can just take 10 mins out of a coffee break with a colleague and talk to them about their experiences. Or instead of a full ethnographic field study you can ask a friend if you can spend a bit of time at their workplace with a notebook to observe what their needs are. Needless to say the more seriously you take this the more you will get out of it, but on the other hand something is definitely better than nothing. It is amazing how much more deeply you will understand the problem at hand after spending time listening to people’s frustrations and watching their interactions before you start trying to sell them on your proposed solution. &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please make sure to get proper consent and take ethical considerations into account when doing this research!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As researchers and developers we might have a bias towards quantitative research methods. But, especially in the early stages, limiting yourself to these approaches will constrain the questions you can ask far more than is desirable. Qualtitative techniques such as interviews and observation allow to find answers to questions that you will likely have never even thought to ask, and these answers can be invaluable for the trajectory of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quasi-quantitative-comparison&quot;&gt;A quasi-quantitative comparison&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still don’t beleive me? Fine I’ll try to explain it using graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graph of user-centered vs normal design&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/ucd-plot.svg&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://extremely-alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/228/&quot;&gt;View this as an Iodide Notebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These curves assume that the ability to change a core paradigm of the software you are building has an follows an inverse logistic function, and the probability of you finding out that the paradigm needs to change is linearly related to the number of users your project has. For the user centered design curve we are better able to find things that need changing at the very start of the project, when it is easy to be able to make these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might be a little contrived but the point stands, human-centered design is not only a great pattern for user experience, but also allows you to -I hate using this phrase- “fail early”, which is presumeable a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Science for Experimental Design - loopy stuff</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not a new concept. But when people talk to me about improving the scientific process it really resonates with me when they talk about feedback loops. This framework is broad enough to encompass most ways in which we can think about improving science, but also makes explicit what actions need to be taken, and where bottlenecks are likely to arise. Here are a few examples of how people have used these cycles to make/explain progress/problems in scientific processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var visible = 1;
function swap() {
  let turn_off = document.getElementById(&quot;img&quot;+visible);
  visible = visible &gt;= 3 ? 1 : visible + 1;
  
  let turn_on  = document.getElementById(&quot;img&quot;+visible);
  turn_off.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
  turn_on.style.display = &quot;&quot;;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h4 style=&quot;float:left; margin-top:5px&quot;&gt;Examples of feedback looks in the scientific process.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;button onclick=&quot;swap()&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;img1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was super excited when the first thing I saw at the Data Science for Experimental Design workshop, held at the Turing Institue, was Daphne explaining how we were going to cover each part of the cycle. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to get a copy of that slide yet, but from the other images you might be able to imagine how it might look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loop-number-1---optimising-experimental-design&quot;&gt;Loop Number 1 - Optimising Experimental Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two talks of the day discussed optimisation algorithms for experimental design. Here we focus on how we can implement closed loop systems that enable us to run experiments that make optimal uses of the resources available, both in terms of time and cost. We were told how finding solutions to these systems can be hugely computationally expensive, and discussed some potential avenues to find shortcuts that are just as good. It’s worth noting that this type of work involves collaborating with statistians and data scientists in the &lt;em&gt;planning&lt;/em&gt; stage of an experiment. All too often we reach out for advice try to solve our inference problems after the data is collected, by which time it may already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loop-number-2---automating-the-discovery-loop&quot;&gt;Loop Number 2 - Automating the discovery loop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/adam-robot-scientist.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Adam, the first ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Scientist&quot;&gt;robot scientist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
Then we moved on to the next level of abstraction, how much of the scientific process can we automate. Ross King told us about Adam, a machine he claims is the first ever robot scientist. In Richard’s view, one of the key steps to sharing science in a reliable way is to use formal, logical languages, rather than natural ones like english or mandarin. By programming a machine using these languages, Richard’s team could extract all the steps from a high-level goal, e.g. “What does this yeast gene do?”, down each layer of abstraction to the observations made on the sensors of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last session before lunch, Dr Vishal Sanchania from Synthace, described Antha, a software platform that has a somewhat smaller remit that Richards robot scientists, but works out of the box with a wide range of hardware, and an thoughtful user-interface. This level of abstraction seems appealing, but many members of the audience were concerned about the lack of clarity in the availability of the source code, or whether there would be an open API that would freely allow third party customisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loop-number-3---sharing-evaluating-and-re-using&quot;&gt;Loop Number 3 - Sharing, Evaluating, and Re-Using&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the break we had the reproducibility crew and Dr Rachael Ainsworth and Dr Sebastien Besson. Dr Besson spoke about his lab’s project &lt;a href=&quot;https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/&quot;&gt;The Image Data Resource&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/&quot;&gt;Omero&lt;/a&gt;. One of the key points in the scientific feedback loop is other researchers being able to explore the data that lead the original authors to make the concolusiont that they did. These databases allow anyone to explore all different types of image data and metadata in their web based browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Ainsworth then took us on a whirlwind tour of open science. From why you should do it, why your worst collaborator is yourself in 6 months time (hint: your past self doesn’t reply to emails), and some great re-mix and re-use of materials from colleagues open science talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“we need to make sure we consider the effects of the changes we seek to drive in as many different contexts as possible [or …] we risk not only being ineffective but actively contributing to existing societal inequalities”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close off the day three scientists with sociological backgrounds lead discussion groups about cultural and contextual considerations for moving forwards with Data Science for Experimental Design. For me two themes resonated loud and often in these sessions, in terms of what we as scientists should be doing to be effective, 1) we need to actively engage those with expertise in driving institutional change to help us in our efforts 2) we need to make sure we consider the effects of the changes we seek to drive in as many different contexts as possible. The latter point is especially important, what works to increase accessibility to science in one context may not work in another, and without taking these considerations into account we risk not only being ineffective but actively contributing to existing societal inequalities. These considerations might be technical e.g. considering low-bandwidth internet users when you share data, or not, e.g. using graphics to aid those who find large sections of text difficult to understand. This can often be extra work but remember also that the wider the audience you consider the wider the audience you have the potential to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Applications</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most applications to most things get rejected, but we’d all rather focus on the times when things went better. By releasing my applications to jobs/grants etc. I am aiming to normalize failing for myself, keep my head on straight, and maybe there will even be some things in there that are useful for other people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Decentralised Git Repositry Sharing and Discovery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Decentralised Git Repo Sharing/Storage backed by Dat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Github have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/&quot;&gt;gone rogue&lt;/a&gt;. Ok, not quite, and the way I see it, it was either they got bought-out or shut-down, and I’m glad it was the former. Whatever your feelings on the above may be, it’d be nice to have a full &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;open&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;decentralised&lt;/strong&gt; place to collaborate on software, and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we decide to build it it’d be good to know what’s out there! In terms of (fully) Open Source Git Repository Browsers there’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/gitiles&quot;&gt;Gitiles&lt;/a&gt; a super minimal browser written in Go.
and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/gitweb&quot;&gt;GitWeb&lt;/a&gt; which is decentralised using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt&quot;&gt;scuttlebut&lt;/a&gt; protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While GitWeb looks really cool, scuttlebutt isn’t a super mature project, and wasn’t greated with file storage in mind, so while it’s great for the repo-browsing interface, it’s not as well suited to hosting the git repositories themselves. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://datproject.org/&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first thought of using Dat for sharing git repo’s I tried to hack something together. I very quickly realised a) it was a bit more complicated than I thought it was going to be and b) there’s no way I was the first person to try and do this. And most importantly c) I was actually trying to do two things at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the dat protocol as peer-to-peer git remote (on the same levele as http(s) and ssh)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create an interface for sharing/discovery of git repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out number &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/code&gt; has already been put together very neatly by @noffle (github and twitter) in a protocol called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noffle/hypergit&quot;&gt;hypergit&lt;/a&gt;. “But wait I thought you said you wanted to use the dat protocol?”, well yes, Dat is actually a wrapper around hyperdrive which itself will soon be written on top of hyperdb which is what hypergit is built on. Confusing? A little. But what matter is that hypergit is using the same core technologies as day, but for now is much faster when dealing with large numbers (thousands) or files - which is especially important for a git repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/code&gt; is still up for grabs, but first we need to work out exactly what we want from a p2p git repository browser. So let’s make a wishlist! On github! Fork &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexmorley/dgit-web&quot;&gt;this page on github&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=&quot;https://beakerbrowser.com/&quot;&gt;Beaker Browser&lt;/a&gt; and add your name/handle below plus answers to any of the questions if you have any opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Continuous Research - Integrating Open Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this then maybe I don’t need to convince you that (wherever possible) it would be really great if researchers like me shared their data, their analysis software, and anything else that would allow someone else to verify, and build upon their research. It’s too early to be complacent, but at least as far as I can see, things are moving in the right direction and soon enough I think funders/publishers will mandate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the promise of someone finding your data/code and re-using it to make new discoveries will not hold for everyone. The manpower required even to just reproduce the computational aspect of every experiment is simply too much, even when everything is shared. As such I think we really need to start thinking about how we can best use our new-found access to research outputs, and how we can keep integrating this years science with last years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I think we’ve already faced some of these challenges, and found solutions, just not in science as such. We have the tools to build massive software projects that contain code that from 10 years and 10 minutes ago but still function correctly. One of they key tools that has enabled this is Continuous Integration, the principle that every change to a code-base is immediately tested against a suite in order to ensure that nothing else has been broken and that the new feature is working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could we apply this to science? Could we build a framework where every time a new dataset is added, or a better algorithm is developed, this will be immediately tested against all previous results to tell us whether “something has broken”, or something new is found. There are some challenges for sure, both technological and cultural, but I beleive it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexmorley.me/ContinuousResearch/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can read my whitepaper on how and why we could build a “Continuous Research” platform. It’s a work in progress and I’d really love your thoughts so please comment below or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexmorley/ContinuousResearch&quot;&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt; or send me an email (alex0morley@gmail.com).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>every-data-scientist-should-know</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK so my job title isn’t actually “data scientist”. But by the end of this year it might be, and while a lot of what I do research-wise is pretty much “data science” there are also a fair few aspects that get ignored in acedemia. While trying to keep growing as a software developer I was super happy to come across &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know&quot;&gt;every-programmer-should-know&lt;/a&gt; - a github repo that acts as a highly curated list of things that are super useful to know as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while trying to fill in a few of the (many) gaps in my data-sci skill stack I decided to create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;s/programmer/data-scientist&lt;/code&gt; version of the list! I’ve started filling it in with a few of my favourite resources but I don’t have enough experience to really fill this out. So if you’ve got an awesome resource that covers something new then add it to the list; or if you’ve found something that you feel is better than what I’ve put there already then replace it! I will try to spend a some time to give every PR a proper look through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway here it is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexmorley/every-data-scientist-should-know&quot;&gt;every-data-scientist-should-know&lt;/a&gt;, let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PS. By &quot;should-know&quot; I don't really mean &quot;should&quot;. I mean, you can learn whatever you feel like.
I just stole the title from someone else ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Golden Rules For Data (and Code) Management</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If Nature News and Comment are writing about it, it must be the next big thing eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Data management is inevitably going to be an essential skill in the open-science era.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SrjnAW46na&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SrjnAW46na&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nature News &amp;amp; Comment (@NatureNews) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NatureNews/status/974339459381645314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;15 March 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot topic or not managing your data properly is super important for scientific/commercial integrity, and most importantly, your own sanity. It’s so important that my department invited their most bestest PhD student to give &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/SSIFellowship/data-talk&quot;&gt;a talk&lt;/a&gt; on it at our last training day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t be bothered to flick through all ten slides then here are said Golden Rules, according to yours truly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Touch the Raw Data&lt;/strong&gt; - back it up and keep read-only copy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a plan!&lt;/strong&gt; - Decide where your data is going to be stored, what its called, when/if it needs to be deleted BEFORE you start collecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document Everything&lt;/strong&gt; - You know who the worst person at replying to emails is about what the sampling frequency of channel X was. Nope not him, it actually yourself from a year ago. Keep the documentation with the data!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the data you want to see in the word&lt;/strong&gt; - Imagine someone was about to give you a dataset that you needed to analyse well in order to get that job you’ve been dreaming about. What would you want it to look like? That’s how yours should look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try not to re-invent the wheel.&lt;/strong&gt; Before you start creating some crazy new schema, storage format or naming protocol - have a quick google, ask your colleagues. Something that’s already being used is likely going to be better in the long run even if you think there’s a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
