        <title>Open Applications</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most applications to most things get rejected, but we’d all rather focus on the times when things went better. By releasing my applications to jobs/grants etc. I am aiming to normalize failing for myself, keep my head on straight, and maybe there will even be some things in there that are useful for other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/textonly/projects/applications&quot;&gt;My Applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Decentralised Git Repositry Sharing and Discovery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Decentralised Git Repo Sharing/Storage backed by Dat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Github have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/&quot;&gt;gone rogue&lt;/a&gt;. Ok, not quite, and the way I see it, it was either they got bought-out or shut-down, and I’m glad it was the former. Whatever your feelings on the above may be, it’d be nice to have a full &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;open&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;decentralised&lt;/strong&gt; place to collaborate on software, and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we decide to build it it’d be good to know what’s out there! In terms of (fully) Open Source Git Repository Browsers there’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/gitiles&quot;&gt;Gitiles&lt;/a&gt; a super minimal browser written in Go.
and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/gitweb&quot;&gt;GitWeb&lt;/a&gt; which is decentralised using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt&quot;&gt;scuttlebut&lt;/a&gt; protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While GitWeb looks really cool, scuttlebutt isn’t a super mature project, and wasn’t greated with file storage in mind, so while it’s great for the repo-browsing interface, it’s not as well suited to hosting the git repositories themselves. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://datproject.org/&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first thought of using Dat for sharing git repo’s I tried to hack something together. I very quickly realised a) it was a bit more complicated than I thought it was going to be and b) there’s no way I was the first person to try and do this. And most importantly c) I was actually trying to do two things at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the dat protocol as peer-to-peer git remote (on the same levele as http(s) and ssh)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create an interface for sharing/discovery of git repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out number &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/code&gt; has already been put together very neatly by @noffle (github and twitter) in a protocol called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noffle/hypergit&quot;&gt;hypergit&lt;/a&gt;. “But wait I thought you said you wanted to use the dat protocol?”, well yes, Dat is actually a wrapper around hyperdrive which itself will soon be written on top of hyperdb which is what hypergit is built on. Confusing? A little. But what matter is that hypergit is using the same core technologies as day, but for now is much faster when dealing with large numbers (thousands) or files - which is especially important for a git repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/code&gt; is still up for grabs, but first we need to work out exactly what we want from a p2p git repository browser. So let’s make a wishlist! On github! Fork &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexmorley/dgit-web&quot;&gt;this page on github&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=&quot;https://beakerbrowser.com/&quot;&gt;Beaker Browser&lt;/a&gt; and add your name/handle below plus answers to any of the questions if you have any opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Continuous Research - Integrating Open Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this then maybe I don’t need to convince you that (wherever possible) it would be really great if researchers like me shared their data, their analysis software, and anything else that would allow someone else to verify, and build upon their research. It’s too early to be complacent, but at least as far as I can see, things are moving in the right direction and soon enough I think funders/publishers will mandate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the promise of someone finding your data/code and re-using it to make new discoveries will not hold for everyone. The manpower required even to just reproduce the computational aspect of every experiment is simply too much, even when everything is shared. As such I think we really need to start thinking about how we can best use our new-found access to research outputs, and how we can keep integrating this years science with last years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I think we’ve already faced some of these challenges, and found solutions, just not in science as such. We have the tools to build massive software projects that contain code that from 10 years and 10 minutes ago but still function correctly. One of they key tools that has enabled this is Continuous Integration, the principle that every change to a code-base is immediately tested against a suite in order to ensure that nothing else has been broken and that the new feature is working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could we apply this to science? Could we build a framework where every time a new dataset is added, or a better algorithm is developed, this will be immediately tested against all previous results to tell us whether “something has broken”, or something new is found. There are some challenges for sure, both technological and cultural, but I beleive it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexmorley.me/ContinuousResearch/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can read my whitepaper on how and why we could build a “Continuous Research” platform. It’s a work in progress and I’d really love your thoughts so please comment below or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexmorley/ContinuousResearch&quot;&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt; or send me an email (alex0morley@gmail.com).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>every-data-scientist-should-know</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK so my job title isn’t actually “data scientist”. But by the end of this year it might be, and while a lot of what I do research-wise is pretty much “data science” there are also a fair few aspects that get ignored in acedemia. While trying to keep growing as a software developer I was super happy to come across &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know&quot;&gt;every-programmer-should-know&lt;/a&gt; - a github repo that acts as a highly curated list of things that are super useful to know as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while trying to fill in a few of the (many) gaps in my data-sci skill stack I decided to create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;s/programmer/data-scientist&lt;/code&gt; version of the list! I’ve started filling it in with a few of my favourite resources but I don’t have enough experience to really fill this out. So if you’ve got an awesome resource that covers something new then add it to the list; or if you’ve found something that you feel is better than what I’ve put there already then replace it! I will try to spend a some time to give every PR a proper look through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway here it is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexmorley/every-data-scientist-should-know&quot;&gt;every-data-scientist-should-know&lt;/a&gt;, let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PS. By &quot;should-know&quot; I don't really mean &quot;should&quot;. I mean, you can learn whatever you feel like.
I just stole the title from someone else ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Golden Rules For Data (and Code) Management</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If Nature News and Comment are writing about it, it must be the next big thing eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Data management is inevitably going to be an essential skill in the open-science era.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SrjnAW46na&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SrjnAW46na&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nature News &amp;amp; Comment (@NatureNews) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NatureNews/status/974339459381645314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;15 March 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot topic or not managing your data properly is super important for scientific/commercial integrity, and most importantly, your own sanity. It’s so important that my department invited their most bestest PhD student to give &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/SSIFellowship/data-talk&quot;&gt;a talk&lt;/a&gt; on it at our last training day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t be bothered to flick through all ten slides then here are said Golden Rules, according to yours truly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Touch the Raw Data&lt;/strong&gt; - back it up and keep read-only copy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a plan!&lt;/strong&gt; - Decide where your data is going to be stored, what its called, when/if it needs to be deleted BEFORE you start collecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document Everything&lt;/strong&gt; - You know who the worst person at replying to emails is about what the sampling frequency of channel X was. Nope not him, it actually yourself from a year ago. Keep the documentation with the data!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the data you want to see in the word&lt;/strong&gt; - Imagine someone was about to give you a dataset that you needed to analyse well in order to get that job you’ve been dreaming about. What would you want it to look like? That’s how yours should look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try not to re-invent the wheel.&lt;/strong&gt; Before you start creating some crazy new schema, storage format or naming protocol - have a quick google, ask your colleagues. Something that’s already being used is likely going to be better in the long run even if you think there’s a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Mind The Gap</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;mind-the-gap---guest-post-at-software-saved&quot;&gt;Mind the gap - Guest post at &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.ac.uk/blog/2018-02-09-bridging-gap-convincing-researchers-different-backgrounds-adopt-good-enough&quot;&gt;Software Saved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Off of the back of a discussion that was part of the interview process &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SoftwareSaved?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SoftwareSaved&lt;/a&gt; we wrote a blog post! Check it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3up1eYfGOL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/3up1eYfGOL&lt;/a&gt; ⌨️💻👨‍🔬👩‍🔬 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NUPM7mzuwI&quot;&gt;https://t.co/NUPM7mzuwI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alexander Morley (@alex__morley) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alex__morley/status/961903586081943553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;9 February 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the interview process for the Software Sustainability Institute’s Fellowship programme we broke out into discussion groups in order to exchange ideas one hurdles that need to be overcome for better integration and recognition of the software within research. Out of one of these groups we dissected out the issues that come up when software engineers and researchers do work on the same project. We tried to tease out exactly how and why different expectations about the main outcomes, or goals, of the project might lead to difficulty. Importantly, we also had a stab at how these conflicts can be avoided/resolved going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound interesting? Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.ac.uk/blog/2018-02-09-bridging-gap-convincing-researchers-different-backgrounds-adopt-good-enough&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Julia Neuro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://julianeuro.github.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julianeuro.github.io/assets/julianeurologo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Julia Neuro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;julia-for-neuroscience&quot;&gt;Julia for Neuroscience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of my PhD Julia has been my programming language of choice for doing anything analysis related and a whole lot more. If you haven’t come across it yet then the &lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; is that Julia solves the “two-language problem” - i.e. we can quickly prototype an analysis in the same language we use for writing a super-performant version. If you want to know more about why Julia Computing (who support enterprise use of the language) just got more than $4 million in funding then have a look &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliacomputing.com/press/2017/06/19/seed-funding.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; … Julia solves the “two-language problem”: It’s Fast &amp;amp; Easy/Concise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, because the language is still pretty new there are still relatively few (cf. Python) well-developed, actively maintained &amp;amp; user-friendly packages for sub-domains like neuroscience. So this coming SFN (Society for Neuroscience conference) a few neuroscientists who have already cottoned on to Julia’s potential in our field will be meeting to have a chat about how to move forward in collating &amp;amp; supporting the maintenance of key neuro-relevant packages for Julia. Exact day/time TBD but if you want to be kept in the loop then please get in touch (email: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alex0morley@gmail.com&quot;&gt;alex0morley@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve copied a draft proposal for the project below; and more info can be found at the project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://julianeuro.github.io/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaNeuro&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a community of both julia users &amp;amp; developers around the field of neuroscience.&lt;/strong&gt;
Most of the mathematical and analytical techniques that are used in neuroscience are covered under other Julia umbrellas (e.g. Digital Signal Processing, Image Analysis, ML etc.). Thus the aim of this group would be to serve as a hub to show/and develop these in neuro-specific use cases. This might be especially important for attracting new neuroscientists to Julia who might otherwise consider themselves uncatered for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julia Neuro Could (potentially) Provide:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A channel/tag on the julia discourse group for neuroscience related questions
-or a gitter/slack channel for collaboration on package-development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a bank of tutorials (notebooks) that use julia for neuroscience (these can either be new or translations of old tutorials written in other languages)
Exposure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A github organisation to host repositories that facilitate any neuroscience related analyses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A website providing exposure for neuroscience-related packages packages + links to funding, meetups etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building up a list (&amp;amp; a highlights roll) of use-cases for julia in neuroscience. i.e. papers &amp;amp; analyses that have been developed in the language, along with stories of how the specifics of julia-lang helped/hindered along the way.
Funding?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obtain and distribute funding for the development &amp;amp; maintenance of neuroscience packages written in Julia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ditto for meetups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Levelling-Up your Open Science game</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[While] technological solutions are maturing, cultural or ideological change is frequently the bottleneck” Open Science MOOC - Force11 &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eO1OlJX_5owiaE2gPeEQl5OfSQtjLhtkhlo6UZs1hQQ&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the principles of open science gain traction amongst many researchers across the globe and the failures of parts of the current system become more and more difficult to ignore the bottleneck is starting to move from scientists&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;wanting&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to work openly to scientists&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;being able&lt;/strong&gt; *to do so. Thus, although this was hardly a concious decision on my part, I have found myself somewhat involved with a few different projects aiming to fill the gap in training scientists in 21st century research practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when one of the editors from the BNA newsletter asked me to write about my take on Open Science at the moment I jumped at the oppurtunity to briefly introduce three of my favourite projects &amp;amp; explain what I think they get right!*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;networked-communities---building-the-cultural--educational-resources-required-for-a-successful-transition-to-open-science&quot;&gt;Networked Communities - Building the Cultural &amp;amp; Educational Resources Required for a Successful Transition to Open Science.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published in the British Neuroscience Newsletter’s autumn edition available &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By8OCp4WlQtuTG5BemNfZmlhWlBleVBIX3B1a3RkSmM3blhB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools many of us use on a daily basis would have barely been imaginable this time last century. But the ways in which we report our findings and judge our peers have barely changed at all. Driven by concerns over reproducibility, as well as by a plethora of technological advances such as the widespread availability of the internet, the best research practices are rapidly being remoulded. While these changes, reflected in a movement often referred to as “Open Science”, are increasingly being included in research evaluation frameworks, many universities are failing to provide the training or incentives that would enable young researchers to keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in many online spaces and non-traditional organizations opportunities for training and networking are flourishing. My introduction to Open Science involved stumbling across the Mozilla Science Lab’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. They support Open Science advocates through “fellowships, mentorship and project-based learning”. For me, the key to their influence in this sphere so far has been their success in facilitating truly inclusive and diverse online communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of such networked communities are apparent even for developing skills in the classroom. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.software-carpentry.org&quot;&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; has grown from the frustration of a few computer scientists trying to teach engineers how to parallelize their programs to a global organisation running intensive two-day workshops for tens of thousands of scientists every year. The development of their teaching materials in an open and collaborative environment has led to their continuous refinement by a diverse community. Its impact is visible in lessons having been altered to fit within an evidence-based educational psychology framework. Too many curricula are created without the recognition of how much research has been done on how people learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Mozilla Science Lab, Software Carpentry, and a multitude of other online resources and communities continue to support scientists’ educational needs, as of yet, there is no one-stop-shop for learning about Open Science. In a massive collaborative project led by paleontologist Jon Tennant, we are proposing the development of a new Open Science Massive Open Online Course (MOOC; &lt;a href=&quot;www.goo.gl/WP9WBw&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;), which will be designed to equip researchers with those skills that are needed to excel in a modern research setting. It aims to foster students’ agency over their self-representation and identity on the Web, and to create individuals with the ability to collaborate openly. Both these skills are crucial for the participation of future scientists in a global research environment.&lt;/p&gt;
