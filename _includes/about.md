## What am I doing?
I am currently taking a "break" from med-school to do my PhD in Neuroscience at Oxford. Within the last two years I have become more and more nerdy, although maybe some of my friends might say it started earlier. I'm pretty big on all things open: open science, open source and open data; although I see being open as a means to an end, rather than a hard principle.

Currently the focus of my PhD is looking at how we encode memories. My lab uses large-scale multi-unit recordings -jargon for we record lots of individual cells in the brain at once- and focuses on the hippocampus - a region that is primarily involved in encoding spatial context. What I want to find out is how the brain chooses which memories to keep, and how multiple aspects of memory are tied together.

## Why Open?
You'll have to check out [my blog](http://alexmorley.me/scienceblog) to get some of the many answers to that question. But I think the main reason is that I can never get round how we as scientists, who are so skeptical of what anyone says, are expected to beleive someones results just because they've given us four numbers and a bar chart. I respect the fact that as a 2-year old PhD student, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but I think I'm in reasonably good company with this opinion.
