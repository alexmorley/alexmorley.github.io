## Abbreviated Life Story (in reverse)
**Software Engineer** I currently do freelance consulting as a software engineer and work 4 days a week at Babylon Health as an AI engineer.
**Mozilla Fellow** I worked on how we can leverage the power of openness, and specifically using the ultimate collaborative tool more commonly known as the internet, to make research a healthier, more inclusive and more successful enterprise.  
**PhD in Neuroscience** Loved diving into data, but got very frustrated at a lot of the systems in place in acedemia that basically de-incentivise collaboration, have massive mental health tolls, and are ultimately holding science back.  
**Medical School -** Got very distracted by neuroscience when I realise we don't have a clue how basically any pyschiatric drugs actually work. So I pressed pause after three years.  
**School -** Always been super interested in how the brain works, and especially on how we can use that knowledge to treat psychiatric conditions.
