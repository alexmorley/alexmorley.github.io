## Abbreviated Life Story
School - Always been super interested in how the brain works, and especially on how we can use that knowledge to treat psychiatric conditions.  
Medical School - Got very distracted by neuroscience when I realise we don't have a clue how basically any pyschiatric drugs actually work. So I pressed pause after three years.  
PhD Neuroscience - Ongoing. Loved diving into data, but very frustrated at a lot of the systems in place in acedemia that basically de-incentivise collaboration, have massive mental health tolls, and are ultimately holding science back.  
Mozilla Fellow - Ongoing. Working on how we can leverage the power of openness, and specifically using the ultimately collaborative tool more commonly known as the internet, to make research a healthier, more inclusive and more successful enterprise.
