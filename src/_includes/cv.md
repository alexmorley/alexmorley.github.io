## Roles & Awards

### Open Research & Computing
<a id="mozillafellow"></a>
**Mozilla Fellow 2018-2019** - As a Mozilla Fellow I worked on several aspects of research software. With [Spikeforest](https://spikeforest.flatironinstitute.org/) and [Continuous Research](https://alexmorley.me/2018/continuous-research/) I'm applying best practices in software development such as continuous delivery to data-heavy research problems. With [Jupyter Span](https://github.com/alexmorley/graphical-notebooks) I'm developing an experimental user interface that focusses on Jupyter's use as an IDE, instead of it's use of generating reports. And with [Back Your Scientific Stack](https://github.com/alexmorley/Back-Your-Scientific-Stack) I worked on ways to make projects that are used by a large number of people more robust and financially sustainable.  

Up-to-date links of related work are kept [here](https://github.com/alexmorley/mozilla-open-fellowship).

**RSE Cloud Computing Fellow 2017-2018** - I have been awarded a fellowship to develop solutions to make it easier for researchers to make use of cloud computing resources. My main project here will be allowing users to perform spike-sorting in the cloud using [MountainLab-JS](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainlab-js). So far we have added an API so that we can add, remove and interface with pods from a Kubernetes cluster.

**SSI Software Sustainability Fellow 2017-2019** - I was awarded a fellowship by the Software Sustainability Institute to continue working on 3 projects: developing the OS and research software module for an [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/about-us/production-team/), continue building a community around using Julia for Neuroscience research ([Julia Neuro](https://julianeuro.github.io/)) and to continue to lead the formation of a Robust Research Initiative in Oxford. 

**MRC BNDU Information Security and Data Access Committee 2017-Present** - I am steering the creation of a Peta-Scale Data Sharing Platform that we are building so that we are able to more effectively share our raw data. I also co-manage the NAS & local compute servers as well as 20+ linux workstations. 

**Open Source Contributor 2017-Present** Alongisde my main projects I contribute bug fixes / features to lots of the software that I use. I also try to maintain a presence on forums such as Stack Overflow where I feel I can be helpful. All of this can be seen on [my github](https://github.com/alexmorley).


 
### Neuroscience Research
**DPhil in Neuroscience (MRC BNDU, University of Oxford) 2016-2019** - During my first year and half I designed and performed electrophysiological recording experiments in freely behaving mice. During that time, and since, I have been analysing the data from those experiments, as well as supervising the collection of more data and analysing data for other projects in the lab.

During this time I also co-implemented a continuous algorithm-benchmarking application & website with collaborators at the Flatiron Institute which, while still in alpha, handles the application of a diverse range of software to many datasets that are 100s of TB each. I also gained a lot of experience using a wide variety of machine learning approaches, from linear models & bayesian approaches to multilinear tensor models such as MPCA. I applied these to neural data in order to predict behaviour, and interrogated the modelsâ€™ parameters in order to better understand the underlying neural processes.


**FHS Project in Neuroscience (Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Calgary, Canada)** - During my undergraduate I was awarded a scholarship to perform a research project in Canada. I investigated the role of the CRH (Corticotropin Release Hormone)-positive neurons in the hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry, optogenetics and behavioural testing.
