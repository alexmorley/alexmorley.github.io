Medium to large organizations with software at the core of their offering all run into the same sets of problems:
- We have 5x the number of engineers we had X years ago, why are we building so slowly?
- We are spending a fortune on hiring.
- Most of our engineers are leaving after a year or two.
- Why aren't are teams collaborating effectively?

There are countless causes for any ones of these problems. But if around half or more of your engineers are "Senior" or if you don't hire Junior engineers then this post is for you. If not then no need to read one.

*Why do we hire senior developers?*  
As an engineering manager I only want to hire the best for my team. We have a headcount limit and senior engineers will get more done. We don't have the capacity to train and mentor junior engineers. As a recruiter or talent manager I want to show that I can bring in the best talent. As a CEO I want to be able to say that we only hire the best, that we have higher standards than our competitors.

For many individuals in any organization hiring senior makes the most sense. But all of these views suffer from the same problem as the folk closely studying the different parts of elephant.

So let's zoom out. From an organizational perspective why would it be worth paying (a lot) more for senior developers? **We assume that they can do 2x the work while costing less than 2x (including salary and overheads).**\*

Let's dive in a bit more into the **2x the work** part. 2x what work? Can a senior engineer design a major new component faster than a junior one. Sure probably way more than 2x faster and probably much better too. Experience is really important here. But what about debugging an issue that has come in from a client? Sometimes they might be faster but sometimes it won't make a different who is looking at the issue. What about propagating a configuration change across some services? Adding an endpoint to expose some existing functionality?

So, as always, it depends. In some scenarios having an engineer with 10 years of experience under your belt will be invaluable. For other things it won't. The question becomes how many really experienced engineers do you need. For how much of the work that's done everyday in your org will our 2x work > 2x cost assumption hold? If you can honestly tell me that most of the work that its done is complex or high-level enough that experience matters that much then great. Your systems are probablly *very* well designed.

<!--Also:
- context-switching / chunking (better to have one head full-time than half-a-head half-time)
- often the developer isn't the bottleneck
- task optimization-->

That's all well and good you say. But I still reckon that hiring senior devs is more efficient (per $) for getting stuff done, no matter the task. I'll take your word for it (everywhere is different) but are you running into any of the other problems mentioned at the start?

- We are spending a fortune on hiring.

Senior developers are hard to recruit. Their salaries are in the ranges where larger sums of money make less of a different to them than their junior counterparts. Hiring is always going to be hard. And hiring junior developers is not easy (especially as they have less on their CV for the intial filtering stage) but it is easier to hire them once you have found them.

- Most of our engineers are leaving after a year or two.

Hiring mostly senior engineers is a recipe for dis-satisfaction:
- <br>
    - It massively decreases opportunity for mentor-mentee relationships which tend to benefit both parties.
    - It reduces the leadership opportunities for senior developers. This is often high on the list of a senior developer's desires.

Flat structures are great but people need a path forward for their careers and that usually requires leadership opportunities whether your are on the management or individual contributor track.

- Why aren't are teams integrating?

OK this one might be a bit of a long-shot. But I have a pretty strong hunch that having more junior devs would help. Integration between teams within an organisation is usually a good idea long-term but the incentive of the teams to do so is often lacking. The time of each senior dev is often seen as so valuable by decision makers that they are reluctant to sacrifice it for these internal projects. These projects are often ideal fits for junior devs and can provide serious value to the org long-term.
