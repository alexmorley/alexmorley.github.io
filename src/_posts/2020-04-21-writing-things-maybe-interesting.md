Hey ðŸ‘‹. Going to be writing some things down over the next few weeks to work on the art and maybe provide something slightly less boring that sitting at home staring at the wall.

Thinking about:

- On moving from acedemia to "industry". How no one, even the people that are reading our work, has a clue what we\* do as scientists or how we do it.

- Coding and art. Am a total newbie but loving playing around with new languages and concepts and making things that you could almost call art (a bar which my hand-drawn drawings do not meet).

- Why organizations should be hiring more junior developers. A lot of devs are finding their way in freelance work at the moment. That works for some but I think everyone would win if there were more opportunities for junior devs to work as part of a bigger team.

\* I'm still a scientist, right?
