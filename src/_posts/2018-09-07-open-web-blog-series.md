I loving hearing about what projects other software developers, data scientists, and science scientists are building to make their sphere of the web a better, cooler or weirder place. For the last couple of years I've spend most mornings diving into all of my feeds searching for cool stuff before I even get out of bed. Unfortunately, I'm usually cut short by having to go and do my real job, i.e. actually doing research. But this year as a [Mozilla Open Science Fellow](https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/) I'm going to be able to set some time to really dive into some of these projects and report back what I've found ðŸŽ‰.

I'm still trying to work out the best way to do this but planning on having two sections. A couple paragraphs aimed at trying to convince anyone, tech-savvy or not, why the project is exciting. And then the rest will be a deep dive into some of the details that I find interesting.
