Want to hack on some crazy ideas for taking `.ipynb`'s to the next level? I'd like someone to help me iterate on a few prototypes for extensions on the jupyterlab interface.

#### (Soft) Requirements:
- Javascript expertise (typescript a bonus)
- Experience developing interactive applications on the web

If you're not sure whether you fit the above, or think you have something else to offer, please enquire/apply anyway!

#### Desired:
- Experience with Jupyter as a user
- Experience with Jupyter or JupyterLab as a developer

#### Terms
- 1-2 month contract in the first instance (possibility for extension depending on funding)
- 2-5 days a week
- Work should take place between July-November

#### Apply
Send an email to alex@alexmorley.me (before June 24th) with:

- Two-three sentences on why you'd be excited to work on this.
- One or two sentences highlighting what skills you could bring to the project.
- EITHER: links to some of your relevant work (or descriptions of it if it's not public)  
  AND/OR: your CV
- Your hourly rate

#### Questions?
Ask here or send me an email alex@alexmorley.me

### The Project

The aim is test potential solutions for better supporting users who use Jupyter for exploratory data-analysis.

There's some more info [in these slides.](https://alexmorley.me/graphical-notebooks/presentations/csv_conf/impress.js/index.html#/markdown) ...

and in these videos & prototypes (which discourse won't let me embed...)
