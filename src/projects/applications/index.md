title: Applications

Most applications to most things get rejected, but we'd all rather focus on the times when things went better. In an attempt to confront my fear of failure I'm going to try to post all of my applications (where appropriate) here from now on. I'll update them later on when I find out how they went. I make no promises that they'll be anything useful here.
