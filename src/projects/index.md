:mortar_board: Educational  
**[Every Data Scientist "Should" Know](https://github.com/alexmorley/every-data-scientist-should-know)**  
A collection of (mostly) technical things every data scientist might want to know - `s/programmer/data-scientist/g` of every-programmer-should-know by @mtdvio.

:art: Art  
**[Alex Cycles the World](/projects/mini-projects/cycle)**  
A visualisation of places I've cycled in the world. A very early project of mine I used to get my head around manipulating svg in the DOM using javascript.

:computer: Software  
**[Jupyter Span / Graphical Notebooks](https://github.com/alexmorley/graphical-notebooks)**  
Computational notebooks that reflect the mental model of humans. We are developing an experimental new UI for Jupyter that reflects their use as an IDE for data science and seperates out this use case from report-generation.

:closed_book: Book  
**[The Turing Way - A Guide to Reproducible Data Science](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)**  
The Turing Way is a lightly opinionated guide to reproducible data science. Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce at the end.

:computer: Software  
**[Spikeforest](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest)** / **[MountainLabJS](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainlab-js)**  
A framework supporting continuous benchmarking of spike sorting software. Designed for use in any benchmarking application especially where big datasets and long-running algorithms are the norm. Includes wrapping of spike sorters in singularity containers and python classes (or JSON objects), job batching, comparison with ground truth, and processing using remote compute resources.

:scroll: Paper  
**[Continuous Research](https://github.com/alexmorley/ContinuousResearch)**  
A paper exploring the benefits and routes to fully applying continuous development prinicples to scientific research.

:art: Art  
**[Heartbeat](/projects/mini-projects/heartbeat)**  
My first "proper" art project, heartbeat is a generative art piece that uses simulations built in Rust and Nannou to create visualisations centered around a beating heart.

:mortar_board: Educational  
**[Julia Neuro](https://julianeuro.github.io/)**  
A collection of people, papers and packages using Julia (the programming language) to do neuroscience.

:wrench: Tool  
**[Hackathon / Sprint Live - Watch The Turing Way](https://github.com/alexmorley/watch_turing_way)**  
A micro-app that tracks contributions during a sprint.

:wrench: Tool   
**[Code of Conduct Builder](https://github.com/alexmorley/CodeOfConduct.Builder)**  
An app that allowed you to build a code of conduct from a set of templates and provided guidance about how to make them work. Probably the first non-scientific app I ever wrote. Only time I ever touched PHP :sweat_smile:.

:wrench: Tool   
**[Back Your Scientific Stack](https://github.com/alexmorley/Back-Your-Scientific-Stack)**  
A proposal to emulate, and build upon, the work done by backyourstack.com, in order to inspire recognition and funding for the open source projects that a lot of scientists rely on. The core goal is to encourage funders to accept (and grantee's to apply for) donations to open source projects as part of their grant.  

:wrench: Tool  
**[Feed.Me](https://github.com/alexmorley/feed.me)**  
A browser-extension to customise (social media) feeds client-side. The aim is give anyone the power to take control over the algorithms that dictate what they see on social media.  

:floppy_disk: Database  
**[Meta Open Database](https://github.com/alexmorley/meta-open-database)**  
Our aim is to create a database that will provide, and link, information about the multitude of factors that determine whether a piece of tech is right for you. This project also acts as a backend to Back You Scientific Stack.
