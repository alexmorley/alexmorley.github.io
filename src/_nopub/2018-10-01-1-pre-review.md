Every month or so a group of us in my unit sit down together and discuss a research paper in as much detail as we can for an hour and half. Usually everyone reads it beforehand, but one or two people will present their thoughts on it first before we deep dive into the details. I'd argue that 10 neuroscientists sitting together chatting about a paper is probably the most intense peer review can get. We often find hidden gems, improvements that would make the paper better, and always end up with a bunch of questions to ask the authors. These meetings are usually referred to as "journal clubs" and have been taking place all over the world for some time.

What usually happens with all this feedback though? Nothing. Even we often forget about the issues we discussed. And unless one of us knows the authors personally the feedback very rarely reaches them. Even if it did, there's little the authors can do to make improvements on an already published paper, short of issuing a corrigendum\*, which isn't something people tend to like doing.

This isn't a great situation. So from now on we are choosing where we can to discuss pre-prints\* in our journal clubs. Pre-prints are research papers posted online *before* they undergo traditionall peer-review in a journal, and so they are at a stage where changes can often still be made. We may thus choose to email our comments/questions to the authors so they can consider them, but this isn't an entirely transparent way of doing things, and the authors might not be the only people who would benefit from reading the comments, nor the only people capable of replying to them. So we'd like to find an open forum for sharing our feedback. Enter [PRE-Review](link).

PRE-Review is a #### run by three scientsts #####. They provide a group on [authorea]() for sharing reviews, as well as guidlines for writing them and formats for organising journal clubs that focus on reviewing pre-prints. What they do is already cool, but they have their sights on building their own platform for pre-print reviews, based on ######. This will allow #####.

Importantly, one of the things that attracts me to PRE-review over some [other open forums for sharing reviews]() is their explicit aim to provide constructive feedback for the authors and the community, rather than just trying to tear it down. This, I think, as well as their focus on journal clubs, is unique, and puts the projects in good stead to make the biggest, hardest, changes in scientific practice, which surround the cultures of competition and collaboration.
