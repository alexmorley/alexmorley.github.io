Today I went to a satellite event for [Open Con 2016](http://www.opencon2016.org) in Cambridge, mainly because a it has some awesome speakers like Erin Mckiernan but also because I somehow seemed to have missed the fact that there was a similar event in Oxford the week before (woops...). What is Open Con? Well in the organisers words Open Con is: 

> *a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data...*

Quite a tall brief for a one-day satellite event to fill, but I really have come away properly invigorated to work on some projects I have had on the backburner, as well as some new collaberations with some awesome Cambridge folk.

The day was kicked off rather spectucularly by Erin who walked us through -without slides *gasp*- [her paper](https://t.co/HszKqeQ0ZP) that was in Elife earlier this year. I've read the paper a few times now but still learnt a lot from the talk. 

The main conclusion, which Erin is a very strong advocate for, is that Open Science is there to *help* researchers succeed not hinder them. In an ideal world should not be a sacrifice to be open at all, but even now, Erin argues, there are lots of advantages, and not too many drawbacks. Our challenge is to move towards a community in which a) open is the default and b) researchers know that they will be rewarded for this. Things are moving in this direction already, and lot's of the scare stories about open researchers not getting jobs are probably not representative.

If you haven't read the paper, then read it, it's better than anything I'm going to write here. If you are still here for some reason and haven't read it then I guess this figure is the highlights: *Open Access Papers get more citations*:

And if you wondering whether your journal is going to let you do this, or whether your funding agency will pay for this you can check their policies at two awesome website I hadn't heard of before called Sherpa [Romeo](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) and [Juliet](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/index.php). 

Erin also told us that for now we still need to talk about impact factor, even if we know its flawed -which it is, and you should sign the [SF Dora commitment](http://www.ascb.org/dora) if you agree. While we still need to keep pushing for progress meeting people/institutions closer to where they are now can make a big difference in terms of impact. 

More coming soon...
