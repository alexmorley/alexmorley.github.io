Today I went to a satellite event for Open Con in Cambridge, because a it has some awesome speakers like Erin Mckiernan but also because I somehow seemed to have missed the fact that there was a similar event in Oxford next week. They must not have tweeted it...

Erin gave the first (and keynote talk) where she walked us through her [paper](https://t.co/HszKqeQ0ZP) that was in Elife earlier this year. I've read the paper multiple times but still learnt a lot from the talk. Key points which I would like to highlight (check the paper for evidence/references):
- Open Science is there to *help* researchers succeed not hinder them. It should not be a sacrifice to be open. Our challenge is to move towards a community in which researchers are rewarded for being open, things are moving in this direction already, and lot's of the scare stories about open researchers not getting jobs are not representative. 
- Open Acess Papers *get more citations*
- For now: we need to talk about impact factor, even though we know its flawed. We need to push people forward, but also go someway to meeting them where they are.

And there were a few things I had not heard of before:
- You can commit to beleiving in outputs beyond what is reflected in Impact Factors here at [SanFran Dora](http://www.ascb.org/dora/)
- Sherpa [Romeo](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) and [Juliet](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/index.php) for checking publisher and funding policies on Open Acess respectively
