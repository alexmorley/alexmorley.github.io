title: "Open Con Cambridge - 2016"

Today I visited Cambridge for a [Open Con 2016](http://www.opencon2016.org) satellite event. I went because it has some awesome speakers -like Erin Mckiernan- but also because I somehow seemed to have missed the fact that there was a similar event in Oxford the week before (woops...). What is Open Con? Well in the organisers words Open Con is: 

> *a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data...*

Quite a tall brief for a one-day satellite event to fill, but I really have come away properly invigorated to work on some projects I have had on the backburner, and have fostered some potential new collaberations with some of the awesome Cambridge folk.


## Erin McKiernan - How open science helps researchers succeed

The day was kicked off rather spectucularly by Erin who walked us through -without slides *gasp*- [her paper](https://t.co/HszKqeQ0ZP) that was in eLife earlier this year. I've read the paper a few times now but still learnt a lot.

Erin's main message is that Open Science is there to *help* researchers succeed not hinder them. In an ideal world it should not be a sacrifice to be open at all, but even now, Erin argues, there are already lots of advantages, and very few drawbacks. Our challenge is to move towards a community in which a) open is the default and b) researchers know that they will be rewarded for this. Things are moving in this direction already, and lot's of the scare stories about open researchers not getting jobs, or getting scooped, are probably not representative.

If you haven't read her paper, then read it, it's better than anything I'm going to write here. One of many highlights of the paper is this striking first figure: *Open Access Papers get more citations*:

And if you wondering whether your journal is going to let you do this, or whether your funding agency will pay for this you can check their policies at two awesome websites I hadn't heard of before called Sherpa [Romeo](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) and [Juliet](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/index.php).

Erin also told us that for now we still need to talk about impact factor, even if we know its flawed -which it is, and you should sign the [SF Dora commitment](http://www.ascb.org/dora) if you agree. While we still need to keep pushing for progress meeting people/institutions closer to where they are now can make a big difference in terms of impact. 

## Laura James, Mainstreaming Open

"Don't let the good be the enemy of the perfect" is a sentement that somewhat came through from Erin's talk but was really brought home by Laura James -previously CEO of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org)- and it's something I have always mixed feelings about. It's clearly a broad concept and it's something I often tangle with when thinking about politics politics as well as science politics. Young folk are often charged with being too idealistic but its often the case that if you want to see a small change, you need to aim for a much bigger one.

As someone who's been swept up in Open ideals recently it was probably good for me to be reminded that we have to remember that Open is ultimately a means to an end. For Laura, it shouldn't be hard & fast principle for how to undertake any project but instead used wherever it will make things better. It's still hard for me to think of many places in Science that wouldn't benefit from being more Open, but I will remember now to keep in mind *why* I want these areas to be more open; what is the end-goal and how will Open make that more achievable.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open is &quot;under the hood&quot;, don&#39;t talk about it explicitly but it has huge effect on humanitarian impact we can achieve. <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieJ">@LaurieJ</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openconcam?src=hash">#openconcam</a></p>&mdash; Erin McKiernⓐn (@emckiernan13) <a href="https://twitter.com/emckiernan13/status/801761764786446336">24 November 2016</a></blockquote>

Laura gave what seemed to me like two very different perspectives on Open Source while describing her work with [Field Ready](http://www.fieldready.org/) - a humanitarian project using 3D printing to make supplies in the field. Both seem equally valid and had me thinking for much of my 2 hr journey back to Oxford.
Most people would agree that one of the aims of Open is to "empower the many rather than the few". However we have to also consider that being a position to Open Source -i.e. to release your work for free- is a position of privelage. From which my take home would be that we should be careful before imposing this condition on others.

## Foucus group - Is outreach necessary for true Open Access research?

During the afternoon session we got into groups and each discussed a single topic related to Open Access. I chose one entitled *"Making a paper OA is not necessarily sharing it -perhaps we should be writing in a more understandable way"*. When I read the first part of the questions I thought, sure making OA isn't even close to sharing it, you also need to share the results, data and steps in between (usually code). I have thought for some time that publicly-funded work should be publicly accessible. But, what the author of this question was hitting on, is that *publicly accessible* also means that we have to communicate what our work means. For sure, not everyone will be able to understand the article itself. And beyond all of the other great reasons for outreach shouldn't we have to justify to people why we are spending *their* taxes on our research.

It is of course, worth mentioning that with this ever-increasing pile of things scientists are expected to do it is important that funders/institutions provide, and reasearchers take advantage of, sufficient support. This could be in the form of training, journalists, data-management experts etc. In a lot of cases a lot of this infrastructure is in place, but many scientists don't know about it so scientists: ask your librarian/funder for help and librarians/funders: keep telling us what you've got!
