Today I went to a satellite event for [Open Con 2016](http://www.opencon2016.org) in Cambridge, mainly because a it has some awesome speakers like Erin Mckiernan but also because I somehow seemed to have missed the fact that there was a similar event in Oxford the week before (woops...). What is Open Con? Well in the organisers words Open Con is: 

> *a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data...*

Quite a tall brief for a one-day satellite event to fill, but I really have come away properly invigorated to work on some projects I have had on the backburner, as well as some new collaberations with some awesome Cambridge folk.

The day was kicked off rather spectucularly by Erin who walked us through -without slides *gasp*- [her paper](https://t.co/HszKqeQ0ZP) that was in Elife earlier this year. I've read the paper a few times now but still learnt a lot from the talk. 

The main conclusion, which Erin is a very strong advocate for, is that Open Science is there to *help* researchers succeed not hinder them. In an ideal world should not be a sacrifice to be open at all, but even now, Erin argues, there are lots of advantages, and not too many drawbacks. Our challenge is to move towards a community in which a) open is the default and b) researchers know that they will be rewarded for this. Things are moving in this direction already, and lot's of the scare stories about open researchers not getting jobs are probably not representative.

If you haven't read the paper, then read it, it's better than anything I'm going to write here. If you are still here for some reason and haven't read it then I guess this figure is the highlights: *Open Access Papers get more citations*:

And if you wondering whether your journal is going to let you do this, or whether your funding agency will pay for this you can check their policies at two awesome website I hadn't heard of before called Sherpa [Romeo](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) and [Juliet](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/index.php). 

Erin also told us that for now we still need to talk about impact factor, even if we know its flawed -which it is, and you should sign the [SF Dora commitment](http://www.ascb.org/dora) if you agree. While we still need to keep pushing for progress meeting people/institutions closer to where they are now can make a big difference in terms of impact. 

"Don't let the good be the enemy of the perfect" is a sentement that somewhat came through from Erin's talk but was said more explicitly by Laura James -previously CEO of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org)- and it's something I have mixed feelings about. It's clearly a broad concept and it's something I often tangle with when thinking about politics politics as well as science politics. Young folk are often charged with being too idealistic but its often the case that if you want to see a small change, you need to aim for a much bigger one.

The thing that Laura said which really did hit home for someone who's been swept up in Open ideals recently is that we have to remember that Open is ultimately a means to an end. To her, it shouldn't be hard & fast principle for how to undertake any project but used wherever it will make things better. It's still hard for me to think of many places in Science that wouldn't benefit from being more Open, but I will remember now to keep in mind *why* I want these areas to be more open; what is the end-goal and how will Open make that more achievable.

During the afternoon session we got into groups and each discussed a single topic related to Open Access. I chose one entitled *"Making a paper OA is not necessarily sharing it -perhaps we should be writing in a more understandable way"*. When I read the first part of the questions I thought, sure making OA isn't even close to sharing it, you also need to share the results, data and steps in between (usually code). I have thought for some time that publicly-funded work should be publicly accessible. But, what the author of this question was hitting on, is that *publicly accessible* also means that we have to communicate what our work means. After all shouldn't we have to justify to the taxpayer why we are spending *their* money on our research.

It is of course, worth mentioning that with this ever-increasing pile of things scientists are expected to do it is important that funders/institutions provide, and reasearchers take advantage of, sufficient support. This could be in the form of training, journalists, data-management experts etc.
