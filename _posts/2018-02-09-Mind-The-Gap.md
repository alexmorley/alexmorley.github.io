## Mind the gap - Guest post at [Software Saved](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2018-02-09-bridging-gap-convincing-researchers-different-backgrounds-adopt-good-enough).

During the interview process for the Software Sustainability Institute's Fellowship programme we broke out into discussion groups in order to exchange ideas one hurdles that need to be overcome for better integration and recognition of the software within research. Out of one of these groups we dissected out the issues that come up when software engineers and researchers do work on the same project. We tried to tease out exactly how and why different expectations about the main outcomes, or goals, of the project might lead to difficulty. Importantly, we also had a stab at how these conflicts can be avoided/resolved going forward.
