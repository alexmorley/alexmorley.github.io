**Today I learned what TIL means.** Actually I found that out what a few weeks back. But I still haven't looked up what "TFW" means... Anyway here's a post a plan to do weekly (let's see how that goes) where I write down something I learned each day. Might be boring, might not. No ones forcing you to read this anyway.

### Monday
Learnt a few more introductory LaTeX commands: 
- `\includegraphics{}` to insert my the first couple of figures. 
- Learnt how to use `~\autocite{}` & Overleaf/Zotero integration to easily include references in my LaTeX project.

And how to use latex in markdown rendered using Jekyll (i.e. on this site). 
$ J(x) = \int{L(t, x, \dot{x}) dt} \$

### Tuesday
I guess I had forgotten this one because I used to use it a bit but ctl-R for searching through your .bash_history is ðŸ‘Œ.
