# Breaking Changes
## "A change in one part of a software system that causes other parts to fail"

Whenever we work on any project, be it software or anything else, we always want to make improvements. In the software world these updates can be very neatly divided into two catagories. Some improvements such as a bug-fix or an added feature might fit perfectly within the existing platform, and a user's experience may improve after these updates without any hassle. This is great, and its not too hard to make the decsion of whether or not to implement such a change if everything else is going to stay the same. Sometimes however you hit a point where you realise that a particular feature you would like to see is going to require some major upheaval. Everything that has been built so far assuming X and you would like to change that to Y. So now we have to think about not only whether this change will be an improvement, but also whether it is worth the cost of making that change.

If you haven't guessed it by now I am pretty convinced that we have got to the stage in science where we need to make some of these breaking changes. We can try and encourage people to share their data, but there is no incentive in the current system to do so (well, not enough incentive anyway). We can talk about ignoring impact factors and big journals but if we keep thinking that the end goal of a piece of science is a pdf document then we are still missing the point.
