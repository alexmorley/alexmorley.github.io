> "[While] technological solutions are maturing, cultural or ideological change is frequently the bottleneck" Open Science MOOC - Force11 [Abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eO1OlJX_5owiaE2gPeEQl5OfSQtjLhtkhlo6UZs1hQQ)

As the principles of open science gain traction amongst many researchers across the globe and the failures of parts of the current system become more and more evident the bottleneck is starting to move from scientists *wanting* to work openly to *scientists being able* to do so. Thus, although this was hardly a concious decision on my part, I have found myself somewhat involved with a few different projects aiming to fill the gap in training scientists in 21st century research practices.
