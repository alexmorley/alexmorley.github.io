Hi there! This is a placeholder for me to write some live notes about what cool things I learn at the Open Science day at the MRC CBU.

11:00 am - After delayed trains and a car with a flat battery I've missed the first sessions on reproducibility, and just managed to catch the end of a discussion about preprints and open evaluation.

You know your in a good set of talks when everyone's screen has either a terminal or twitter on it...

Key slide I got to see:
Summary of preprint advantages: early citation, open access, free, early publication ... and more!
Summary of preprint disadvantages: none... 

Don't get me wrong I agree, but maybe we should try and think of all of the possible arguments against preprints before we dissmiss them, not least because scientists tend to be very skeptical of anybody that claims anything doesn't have drawbacks. Even for those already persuaded it can be useful to think through how we might defend our stance against those who like to stick to their traditions.
