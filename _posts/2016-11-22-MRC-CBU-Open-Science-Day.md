Hi there! I wrote some notes about cool things I learnt at the Open Science day at the MRC CBU. 
 
 
## Reproducibility, PrePrints, and why you shouldn't drive...
After delayed trains and a car with a flat battery I managed to miss the first session on reproducibility- by Dorothy Bishop, and only managed to catch the end of a discussion about preprints and open evaluation - by Lauren Cadwaller and Niko Kriegesorte.

I did know it was going to be a good crowd when all of the screens I could see on people laptops were full of terminals and twitter!

Key slide I did get to see from Niko's talk was this one:
Summary of preprint advantages: early citation, open access, free, early publication ... and more!
Summary of preprint disadvantages: none... 



Anyway - all of the slides for the talks are up on the MRC CBU's [website](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/openscience2016/) so you can check out (+find references etc.) any of the talks I do discuss on there.


Don't get me wrong I agree, but maybe we should try and think of all of the possible arguments against preprints before we dissmiss them, not least because scientists tend to be very skeptical of anybody that claims anything doesn't have drawbacks. Even for those already persuaded it can be useful to think through how we might defend our stance against those who like to stick to their traditions.
