Hi there! I wrote some notes about cool things I learnt at the Open Science day at the MRC CBU. 
 
 
## Reproducibility, PrePrints, and why you shouldn't drive...
After deciding using my car would make sure I arrived on time I awoke to a flat battery and so had to get the train -on the lovely new Chiltern trains- and so managed to miss the first session on reproducibility- by Dorothy Bishop, and only managed to catch the end of a discussion about preprints and open evaluation - by Lauren Cadwaller and Niko Kriegesorte.

I was consoled by the fact that when I arrived I knew it was going to be a good crowd as all of the laptop/phone screens I could see contained either terminals or twitter!

The key slide I did get to see from Niko's talk was this one:

(By the way - all of the slides for the talks are up on the MRC CBU's [website](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/openscience2016/) so you can check out (+find references etc.) any of the talks I do discuss there.)

Don't get me wrong I agree with him 100%, and I reckon most of the other people did in the room to, but, whether or not you are talking to the converted, it might have been even more useful to at try and think of all of the possible arguments that people might levy against preprints. Not least because then a) we will be better armed when confronted with these questions in the future and b) because if you say to a group of scientists that there are no disadvantages of something you are just inviting them to disagree with you!


## Open Data at the CBU - Rik Henson
After coffee Rik gave a great overview of what the CBU is doing in terms of Open Data, and where it plansto go over the next couple of years. They recently had their policies audited by the MRC and given that we (at the MRC BNDU in Oxford) are writing up new Data Management plans at the moment, I thought that we might be able to learn a lot from what the CBU are doing.

Rik told us that last year they set up an Open Science commitee and that so far they have implemented a CBU data repository as well as updating their consent forms to allow for data-sharing. If you're interested in the latter I advise you to check out the [Ultimate Consent Form](http://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ultimate.html). In terms of their data repository, I think they hit on one really important thing that I had only vaguely though about before. Their idea was to have levels of access for different datasets so that for e.g. a dataset could be freely downloadable with just a click; or you might have to fill a very short form with an insitituional email address (which would allow better tracking of data-re-use); or for bigger, more valuable datasets, you would have to fill out a detailed form, which a panel would review, asking for specific parts of a dataset and explaining what you will do with them.

The final option was chosen for a large project known as [Cam-CAN](http://www.cam-can.org/index.php?content=dataset), and over 90 requests were received within a week, which highlights both how useful these datasets could be, but also that managing detailed requests forms can be a lot of work!


Another cool thing, which many people might not realise, is that making human data available retrospectively might be easier than you think.

Rik talked about a lot of cool stuff that I haven't mentioned (like MRC CBU "Technical Reports", Pre-Registration & Code-sharing), and there are loads of good resources on his [slides](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Henson_CBUOpenScience_November2016.pdf) so check them out if you want to know more!

- Nature Data Reports - Data Citable

- Consent Forms: MRC CBU have new consent form which includes open data
	- retrospective interpretation CamCAN - risk very low that anyone would object esp as anonomysied
	- Data Protection act "research exemption"

- CBU Data Repository 
	- All papers will have to have data and scripts in Repository
	- Checked by information officer
	- Future use of data protected
	- Where is this kept? University servers? Is it scitable?
	- MRC CBSU bibliography search - you can make open, +minimal form, +fully managed access
	- 90 requests for CAMCan in first week!
	- MRC CBU Technical Reports - Purchase DOIs
