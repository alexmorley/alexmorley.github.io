## Programming Software for Scientists
I spent a lot of time when I started my PhD nerding out on which tools I should use now that I was going to be programming on a daily basis. Here are a few things I still use, things that didn't work out, and things that I wish I'd worked out earlier.

### TMUX (or screen)
Tmux is short for terminal multiplexer and while that sounds like some sci-fi stuff it's basically just a piece of software that manages all of your terminal windows for you. If you spend a lot of time at the command-line, this is a must have. In each "tmux session" you can split your terminals into windows and panes that you can label and jump around easily, which is really nice when your working on projects that have lot's of different components. But the real reason I use this is that is because I can set up a session on one of our remote servers I know that whether I restart my desktop computer, want to work from home or anything else I can just log into the server and carry on where I left off.
- Intial Time Investment: minimal
- Cmd-line or GUI: Cmd-line
- Who's it for?: Everyone who uses the cmd-line regularly

### VIM (Text Editor)
I'm not going to go into this one alot because you can just google "text editor for programming" and read all the (sometimes heated) arguments about which ones best over there. What I will say is that it is useful actually just choosing something, rather than sticking with nano or whatever came installed on your computer. If your going to write code then something with syntax highlighting is a minimal requirement.
- Intial Time Investment: some -vim has a bit of steep learning curve
- Cmd-line or GUI: Both
- Who's it for?: people who value not having to move their fingers very far.
