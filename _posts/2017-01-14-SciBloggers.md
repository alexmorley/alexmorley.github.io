## The most prestigious list of blogs that I tuned into last year, and will continue to watch closely for 2017.
## I'm going to be adding to this list over the next few days so please let me know if you've got any suggestions!

Englighted opinions on both neuroscience & acedemia, Mark's blog does a great job of explaining complex topics ranging from why we need to move away from thinking about single neurons to the processes underlying decision making. Great for both scientists and other folk alike; if you need some stimulating lunchtime conversation starters, look no further.

## by Prof. Dorothy Bishop

One of many blogs written by proffessor of developmental neuropsychology Dorothy Bishop this one contains "ramblings on acedemic-related matters". I first started reading Dorothy's blog as I began to take a serious interest in the publishing and reproducibility crisis that science is currently facing. More interesting for those outside the scientific community might be her regular posts delving into general biological stuff such as the [x and y of sex differences](http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/x-and-y-of-sex-differences.html) or [a common misunderstanding of natural selection](http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/a-common-misunderstanding-of-natural.html).
