title: "Top Ten Science Blogs/Bloggers of 2016"

## The most prestigious list of blogs that I tuned into last year, and will continue to watch closely for 2017.
## I'm going to be adding to this list over the next few days so please let me know if you've got any suggestions!


# <a class="link u-baseColor--link is-touched" href="https://medium.com/the-spike" title="The Spike" aria-label="The Spike"><img class="collectionHeader-logoImage js-collectionHeaderLogoImage" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/1*SXgKbsryKflVpOZrHXY3Eg@2x.png" data-image-id="1*SXgKbsryKflVpOZrHXY3Eg@2x.png" alt="The Spike" data-width="1731" data-height="455"></a> by Mark Humphries

Englighted opinions on both neuroscience & acedemia, Mark's blog does a great job of explaining complex topics ranging from why we need to move away from thinking about single neurons to the processes underlying decision making. Great for both scientists and other folk alike; if you need some stimulating lunchtime conversation starters, look no further.

## by Prof. Dorothy Bishop

One of many blogs written by proffessor of developmental neuropsychology Dorothy Bishop this one contains "ramblings on acedemic-related matters". I first started reading Dorothy's blog as I began to take a serious interest in the publishing and reproducibility crisis that science is currently facing. More interesting for those outside the scientific community might be her regular posts delving into general biological stuff such as the [x and y of sex differences](http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/x-and-y-of-sex-differences.html) or [a common misunderstanding of natural selection](http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/a-common-misunderstanding-of-natural.html).

For those self-proclaimed nerds amongst you C. Titus Brown's blog is a true gem. Currently he is running a mini-series entitled [Envisioning the Scientific Paper of the Future](http://caltech.stacksdiscovery.org/scientific-paper-future) which has been super interesting so far. If you're looking to get into blogging then check out this slightly tongue and cheek article written at the beginning of this year [The top 10 reasons why blog posts are better than scientific papers](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-top-ten-reasons-blog-posts.html).


<a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net"><img src="http://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bloglogo_transparent.png" style="width:1731;height:455;"></a>

Bjoern is a professor of neurogenetics at the Universit√§t Regensburg and writes a great blog about both insect behaviour ([Why Did The Moth Fly Into The Flame?](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/12/why-did-the-moth-fly-into-the-flame/)) as well as some obligatory progressive articles about the state of science and publishing ([Sci-Hub As Necessary, Effective Civil Disobedience](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/02/sci-hub-as-necessary-effective-civil-disobedience/)). This one is probably more for those already involved in acedemia in some form or another, but nonetheless a great way to while away an hour or two while waiting for your immuno/code/mouse/PI to finish running.
