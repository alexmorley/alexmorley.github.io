## This week I learned

### Monday
How to nest tmux shells. Seriously useful when working from home. Check out this gist for the low-down.

### Tuesday
Lot's about Tensor Decompositions... probably more than I'll ever need to know.

### Wednesday
I learned how to lead climb! Forgot what I did the rest of the day.

### Thursday
Git tips. 

Overwrite local changes with remote: `git fetch --all; git reset --hard $remote/$branch`
Pick & Squash (I always forget this one): `git rebase -i HEAD~$ncommits`

### Friday
Starting to get a hold of how to use `@generated` functions properly in julia for writing fast code that works on arrays with unknown dimensions.
